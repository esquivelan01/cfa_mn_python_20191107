# Financial Data Wrangling and Visualization in Python

These are the course materials for the CFA of Minnesota Python training on November 7, 2019.

This course will cover the basics of performing data analysis in a finance context.  All of our analysis will occur in Jupyter Notebooks.


We recommend that you use the Anaconda Distribution for this course.  Instructions for installing Anaconda can be found in **slides/01_download_installation.html**.

There are a series of Jupyter Notebooks in the **tutorials** folder.  Feel free to launch those in Jupyter or JupyterLab.  These are the tutorials we will work through in during the training.  The slides also reflect the content that I will cover.

Please feel free to e-mail me with any question: pritam@umn.edu.


Thanks,

Pritam

# cfa_mn_python_20191107

These are the course materials for the CFA MN Python training on November 7, 2019.

This repository will be updated in the coming weeks, but what is contained here will give you a good sense of the material that we will cover.

There are a series of Jupyter Notebooks in the **tutorials** folder.  Feel free to launch those in Jupyter or JupyterLab and try working through them.  The slides also reflect the content that I will cover.

Please feel free to e-mail me with any question: pritam@umn.edu.


Thanks,

Pritam
